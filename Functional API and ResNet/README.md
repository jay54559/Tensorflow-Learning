# **The purpose of the notebook is the following:**
> ### ResNet50 (Residual Network 50) model for Image Classification of CIFAR 10 dataset using Tensorflow 2.0's Functional API

- The dataset is built-in with the Tensorflow (in tensorflow.keras.datasets), but can also be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- The ResNet research paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

**Note:** The focus of this notebook is not to get the best accuracy but to rather learn the Functional API while learning about and implementing the ResNet.
